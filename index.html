            Having cerifications from Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, I went further to acquire a degree at the prestigious Imo State University.
            I look forward to transition into tech because of the interesting technologies. I remember growing up, i love to open up our radio, tourch, phones, anything, just to
            be sure or see what was inside it that makes it work.

        <h1>Why I joined AltSchool Africa</h1>
        <p>My main goal of joining this world class institution of learning is because, Altschool has a proven track record of building its students who has little or no knowledge in a choosen field and has been able to groom them into a world class product.
            I believe in AltSchool africa, my long term dream of becoming a software engineer will become reality.
            And of course to make bastard money and empower other young folks. </p>
